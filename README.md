This application "Program1" containes a simple dice game to demnstrate the use of Dart programing and a simple example of a few libraries for our research design milestone.
In the program the user enters their name and has the option to roll dice (random number generated 2-12) or stop the game. If the user rolls a 7 or 11 they win $10 but if they roll snake eyes (2) they lose all their winnings. The game keeps track of the players total money won.
